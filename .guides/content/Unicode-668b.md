To overcome the problem of multiple versions of ASCII, the Unicode Consortium was founded to develop and promote a standard which could represent and handle text in most of the world’s writing systems – including Klingon!

Unicode has become the universal standard recognised and used by the major hardware and software manufacturers.

Unicode encodings include UTF-8, an 8 bit fixed width encoding and UTF-16 and UTF- 32 with 16 and 32 bits. 

A 32-bit character set can have 4,294,967,296 possible characters, enough for all known languages.

For compatibility and because ASCI was the previous recognised standard, Unicode characters 0 to 127 are the same as ASCII.
