All characters are processed by a computer as binary codes. 
When we enter a letter from the keyboard a stream of bits is transmitted to the processor. 
It cannot recognise the letter ‘A’ or an exclamation mark, only a set of 1s and 0s.

The list of these binary codes that can be recognised by the computer hardware and software is known as its **character set**.
