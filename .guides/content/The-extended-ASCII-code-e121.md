In the ASCII code, there are 96 printable characters but there was always a need for more characters in order to accommodate foreign languages, mathematical symbols and special symbols for drawing pictures.

As computers process data in 8-bit bytes, it was sensible to extend ASCII to an 8-bit code, which allows 256 codes. 

Unfortunately there was no standardisation and different manufacturers such created their own extended versions with different characters represented by the same codes. 

With the huge popularity of home computing in the 1980s and the proliferation of manufacturers such as Atari and Commodore, each creating their own operating system, there were many different versions of extended ASCII and as a result data could not be transferred between the different systems.
